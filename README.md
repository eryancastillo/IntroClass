This repository contains work I completed as part of a Data Science Basics in R course. The repository contains code to:

read in a new dataset
calculate summary statistics
generate a data visualization

I looked at data related to global measles vaccination coverage and measles cases. I explored differences in measles incidence by variance in country vaccination coverage and GDP. To visualize the data, I created a bubble plot that shows number of measles casess in 2022 and vaccination rate for each country.
